# TravelWisely
This is Travel Wisely, it was initially designed to help me plan dates and activities in NYC but then ballooned out into something much bigger
It uses several APIs: Google Maps API, Weather API, and the Trip Advisor API
One thing I want to mention about the app is the weather icons were made by yours truly in photoshop. Yes they are simple but they are cute which makes the star of the app (pretty priviledge)
